SQRIBBLE 3DS

SQRIBBLE 3DS is a 3DS homebrew drawing application that allows you to draw cool 3D images on a checkerboard canvas. It is a work in progress, but currently allows you to:
- Change brush size using the d-pad (up/down)
- Undo/redo brush strokes (left/right shoulder buttons)
- Clear the canvas (x button)
- Swap bottom and top canvas layers (b)
